					<p>Many business professionals find statistics useful in their work: Financial specialists use statistical
						models to perform portfolio analysis, while forensic accountants rely on statistical methods to
						uncover financial fraud. Therefore, a firm grounding in business statistics is critical to every
						individual who wishes to excel in the accounting profession.
						With the aid of business focused settings, students will learn and master descriptive statistics,
						probability theory and distributions, sampling distributions, inferential statistics and regression
						analysis. Beyond the statistical computations, this module makes attempt to emphasis conceptual
						understanding, interpretation of statistical results and application to case studies.

			<h2>Group Collaborative Learning</h2>
			<h3>What we have learnt so far...</h3>
			<p> 
				So far we have found out how statistics can be applied to the real world by following "input name" on his attempt to start
				his own waffle shop. With the knowledge about Population Distribution, T-Distribution, Central Limit Theorem and Inferential Statistics
				and practiced Population Distribution we are now going to move on to the next part of the activity.
			</p>
			<h3>Introduction to DISCORD platform</h3>
			<p>"Asynchronouse Learning" is the idea that students the should be able to learn the same material at different times and location.
			However, this would not be sufficient to replicate the experience that students can gain from the interactions and discussions
			in a classroom with both their lecturers and fellow classmates. In order to digitalize this classroom experience we are going to participate
			in a group collaborative learning activity on an application called DISCORD. The DISCORD application enables text, image, video and audio
			communication between users in a chat channel.
			</p>
			<h3>How it is going to be conducted</h3>
			<p> Students will be split into groups and would be given "Real World" problems to solve. Students will be invited to join the DISCORD server
				and be assigned their group roles. With the group roles they will be able join the appropriate text and voice channels where they can participate
				in the group activity to solve the "Real World" problems.
