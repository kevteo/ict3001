					<p>
						In practice, we rarely know the population variance required for the Central Limit Theorem. Fortunately, there is another model for sampling distribution called T-distribution. T-distribution is a probability distribution that is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small or when the population variance is not known.
						A T distribution resembles a normal distribution. However, it differs from normal distribution by its degrees of freedom. A T distribution has a smaller number of independent observations, typically  n<30. Hence, when the sample is not large enough, or the population variance is unknown, a t-statistic formula should be calculated as a basis for the T distribution.
						<br/><br/>
						The T-statistic formula is given by:<br/>
						t = [ x - μ ] / [ s / sqrt( n ) ]
						<br/><br/>
						where <br/>
						x = sample mean <br/>
						μ = population mean <br/>
						s = standard deviation <br/>
						n = sample size <br/>
						<br/><br/>
						The degree of freedom (df) is given by = n - 1
						<br/><br/>
						Similar to normal distribution, it is too complicated to compute probabilities (area under curve) of a T-distribution. Hence, a pre-computed table called the t-table is needed.

						John has an average sale per day of 30 waffles. 
						After conducting a 15-day sample testing, John waffles sales per day is 29 waffles with a standard deviation of 5.
						Find the probability that of 15 days selected, John average sales of waffles are no more than 29 waffles.

			<h2 class="major">Central Limit Theorem</h2>
				<div class='tutorial'>
					<p>In Central Limit Theorem, for sufficiently large samples with size greater than 30, the shape of the sampling distribution will become more and more like a normal distribution. </p>
					<p>If there are large enough set of samples then the sampling distribution of mean approaches normal distribution.</p>
					<p>For example, if we put histograms of an average of five fair, 6-sided dice rolls together, this is what it will look like when the number of experiments grows:</p>

					<p>Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn.</p>
					<p>The process for performing inferential statistical study consists of four steps:</p>

					<p>Curiosity question is being formulated as one of five questions about population parameter as follows:</p>
					<img src='./images/tut4_2.png' width='50%' height='50%'>

					<p>There are two basic methods for making inferences about population parameters:</p><br/>
					<h3>1.	Estimation</h3>
					<p>Estimation is further broken into two: Point and Interval estimation</p>
					<p>Point estimate: a single number to estimate parameter</p>
					<p>Interval estimate: a range to contain the population parameter</p>
					<br/>
					
					<h3>2.	Statistical hypothesis</h3>
					<p>There are two theories in this method of inference:</p>
					<p>The <b>alternative hypothesis</b> is a hypothesis proposed by the experimenter The <b>null hypothesis</b> is the negation of the alternative hypothesis</p>
					<p>A decision has to be made to accept or reject a value of population parameter</p>

			<h2>Group Collaborative Learning</h2>
			<hr style='margin: 1px;'>
			<h3><span class='underline'>What have we learnt so far?</span></h3>
			<p>
				We found out how statistics can be applied to the real world by following John on his attempt to start
				his own waffle shop. With the knowledge about Population Distribution, T-Distribution, Central Limit Theorem and Inferential Statistics
				and practiced Population Distribution we are now going to move on to the next part of the activity.
			</p>
			<h3><span class='underline'>Why use Discord?</span></h3>
			<p>
				Asynchronous Learning is the idea that students the should be able to learn the same material at different times and location.
				However, this would not be sufficient to replicate the experience that students can gain from the interactions and discussions
				in a classroom with both their lecturers and fellow classmates. In order to digitalize this classroom experience we are going to participate
				in a group collaborative learning activity on an application called DISCORD. The DISCORD application enables text, image, video and audio
				communication between users in a chat channel.
			</p>
			<h3><span class='underline'>How it is going to be conducted</span></h3>
			<p>
				Students will be split into groups and would be given "Real World" problems to solve. Students will be invited to join the DISCORD server
				and be assigned their group roles. With the group roles they will be able join the appropriate text and voice channels where they can participate
				in the group activity to solve the "Real World" problems.
